We want the Phone number to appear on the main display rather than in the menu in the phone on the tablet so we make it d-none d-lg-inline. Then, We will also write some more code for the website when the width is less than 992px.
Now, We start styling the button that opens up and closes the collapsed mobile menu. Let's go ahead and go back to the code editor and we'll give it some more styles to fit into our overall theme. So the first thing we're going to do, and let us cut and paste some code here that we prepared, is we're going to change the color of the borders around the button. So we can give the button tag an id of our choice and edit the border color and size of the border also. Also the center horizontal lines are actually svg images in the bootstrap so to change we can use the link provided at the bottom of this script to check out how to change the horozontal lines as they do not change like normal text. And We don't really want to keep the name of the restaurant in this gigantic font, even on a small mobile browser. That's just not really going to work. So what we really need to do is squeeze both of those things together and make it much tighter and much smaller font and make this whole yellow section much smaller. 
We're going to check it next.
