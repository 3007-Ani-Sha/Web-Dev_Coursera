# Types
Type is a particular data structure.

Each language defines some built -in types.
Built-in types can beused to build another data-structure
JS has 7 built-in types : 6 primitive nd 1 Object-type.
## Object-Type :
Object is a collection of name/value pairs.
Like in the object.js, We can see that there is a source code that is put inside a object class. It may also contain another objecxt type like social in object.js
## Primitive Types:
Primitive type represents a single immutable value. 
It is a single value i.e. naot an object type.
Immutable means once it's set, it cannot be changed meaning it becomes read-only, also we can create another value based on an existing one.

Types of primitive Types are:

### Booleans :
Booleans can have oinly two values: true or false.
### Undefined :
Undefined signifies that no value has ever been set.
It can have only one value that is: undefined.
We can set a variable to undefined but should NEVER do it. It's meaning is that it is never been defined, so defining it to undefined is counter to its core meaning leading to confusion in the code.
### Null:
Null signifies lack of value.
As opposed to undefined, which is lack of definition.
Can have one value: null.
It's ok to explicitly set a variable to null.
### Number:
Number is the ONLY NUMERIC TYPE in Javascript.
Always represented under the hood as double-precision 64-bit floating point.
JS does NOT have an integer type.
Integers are asubset of doubles instead of seperate data type.
### String:
String is sequence of characters used to represent text.,
Use either single or double quotes each is 100% legal, i.e., 'text' or "text".
### Symbol:
