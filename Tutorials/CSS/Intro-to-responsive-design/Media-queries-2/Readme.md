# Media Queries:
let's look at media-queries.html in this same directory.
Just a H1 just to tell us where we're holding. You know we have in our HTML really is two paragraphs. First one is ID'd with p1, and the second one is ID'd with p2. Let's take a look at the styles that we have for these paragraphs so far. As you can see, we're following our own advice, and we have some base styling that we're going to apply to these paragraphs before we even get to the media queries. We're not going to pay too much attention to H1. That's just really for our web page to look a little bit more decent. We'll pay attention to the paragraph tags however. So here we're targeting our paragraph and basically just giving it a border of 1 pixel solid black and giving it a bottom margin of 15 pixels. And then we're distinguishing each paragraph by using the ID selector. By giving it a particular color in the first paragraph is going to be fairly large. It's going to be 300 pixels by 300 pixels. And the second one is going to be a different color and it's going to be 50 pixels by 50 pixels. Let's take a look as to what this looks like in the browser.
