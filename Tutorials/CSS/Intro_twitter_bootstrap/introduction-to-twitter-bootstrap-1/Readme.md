# Introductionto tTwitter Bootstrap: 
Bootstrap is one of the most popular CSS frameworks which was made by the engineers at Twitter.

## What is Bootstrap?
Bootstrap is the most popular HTML, CSS, and JavaScript framework for developing responsive, mobile first projects on the web.
Let's take it apart a little bit.

First of all, it's the most popular framework. 
While GitHub, which is basically a large website with code repository that has a social component to it, has over 90,000 stars or likes of the Bootstrap project. 
So it's the most popular project on the entire website. And it's been forked over 38,000 times.

Bootstrap consists mostly of CSS. It pre-defines a lot of CSS classes for us. So a lot of the times, especially with a user interface that's a bit more complex than just a single HTML element or something, CSS needs to target a certain HTML structure. 
Well because of that reason, Bootstrap often times requires us to have a particular HTML structure in your HTML page. 
In practice, however, it's not as scary as that sounds. It doesn't really invade our HTML code and make us write some crazy HTML constructs. 
It just asks us to add an extra div here and there and give it a particular class so that the CSS Bootstrap defined would apply properly. 
Its JavaScript framework shouldn't be overlooked either. It has a very cool JavaScript framework actually based on the J Query APIs and plugin architecture that lets you put in, and lets others put in, different plugins that really enhance your website quite a bit.

Bootstrap is also called a mobile first framework. Now what does it mean? 
Well in general, the term means that we deal with how our user interface is laid out on the mobile device first.
In the reality, there are two approaches to what this means. 
There's the purist approach, which says we code your mobile version first. And the claim is that it really helps your content strategy. How are you going to lay out your content, what the content should be. It really forces you to think, what's really important in your content that you're about to present. 

There's also a second approach to what mobile first means. And we can call it not 100% purist approach. So the idea there is that we plan for mobile in your styles. But can start coding with desktop version first, if it feels more comfortable for you, or if it just makes more sense for your project. 
So as far as coding is concerned, either approach starting from mobile and going to desktop or starting from desktop and going to mobile are really two valid approaches.


However, everybody will agree on this, that mobile first definitely means is that we plan for mobile from the start. 
We don't ignore it until the end or the middle of our project. We plan for it from the start. 
And also that CSS framework, whether written by us or we take something like Bootstrap, should be mobile already. 
And what that means is that it shouldn't be an afterthought. Where after we set up our desktop version somehow, we have to write some or include some other CSS that would now kind of magically try to turn this, the entire website into this mobile website as well. 

And interestingly enough, Bootstrap wasn't always a mobile first framework. It used to be, that Bootstrap had a separate CSS file and separate set of classes. If we wanted your website to be responsive or be basically be able to be viewed on mobile devices as well. 
But nowadays, Bootstrap is a mobile first framework. 

## Disadvantages of Bootstrap:
So are there any disadvantages of using Bootstrap versus for example writing our own, like we did in introduction to responsive design. 

Well the number one complaint, the disadvantage of bootstrap, is that it's too big and it's too bloated. And that means there's a lot of features in there that we will probably never use. 
Well, the mitigating factor is we could use selective download on the Bootstrap website and only download the features we actually think we will use. 
But the truth of the matter is even though it is a little bit too bloated, It's not really that bad. 
And the claim also is that we could write your own framework that's more targeted and therefore much smaller. Well, that may be true, but it will take you a lot longer to write it. 
And certainly take you a lot longer to write it just as well as the guys at Twitter did. Which they put a lot of thought and a lot of painstaking decisions into every little turn that, we'll probably just not have the time and the bandwidth to deal with.
