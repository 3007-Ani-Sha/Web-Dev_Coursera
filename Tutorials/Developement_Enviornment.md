First install a text editor like VS Code, Git, Node.js and browser sync.
Then we have to go to Github and create a repo -> then got to settings -> Github Pages -> select the 
branch you want to create your website on as all things on that branch will only appear on your site ->
So select the branch then if you want, select the theme of the site.


Then create site, then an html document for your site and generally all of the server on net take 
index.html to be the default html website document so you can use the address till the site/ folder only 
if your document is index.html otherwise add /site/(name of the file).html to go to ypur website.
