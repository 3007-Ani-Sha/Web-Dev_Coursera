W3C:It is the organization which keeps the standards of the current html standards.
WHATWG: It keeps HTML and keeps evolving the html never fixed, and time to time W3C takes its new set 
of standards or features to make them standards.

Most browsers including google updates these features automatically in order to keep your browser 
compatible to all new types of websites.

Resources to keep track of these changes are:
W3C.org
Caniuse.com tells which browser supports which attributes in order to make decision to have that feature in your site or not.
W3C.org 's validator tells if your html site is compatible with browsers.

So, it might not be possible to provide all browser compatible as there are many, many even are outdated.
So check browser Statistics to check popular web browsers on 'W3schools'
to give compatible sebsite to maostly all popular ones.
