HTML Lists:
lists may be unorderd or orderd 
unordered maybe like a shopping list
for unordered list we use <ul></ul>
to cover the unordered list and surround each item to be bulluted by a <li></li> tag and also if any element of the list contains it's own list like in cookies in example of unordered list.
we suuround the whole cookies and it's list in an <li></li> tag and the inner list inside an <ul></ul> and again each inner list element to 
<li></li>.

If inside an <ul></ul> element an list element is written without <li></li> tag then it gives error or in otherwords, the <ul></ul> tag must contain <li></li> tags only not text.

Ordered list:
To create an ordered list just replace th ul by ol in list tag, the items are covered by <li></li> tag but now sequentially from top to bottom numbering is done like for a recipe. Sublists are treated same as int the unordered list.
